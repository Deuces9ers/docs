# Local Testing

This guide introduces a ready-to-use mock test environment, that contains:
- A local Alto bundler
- A mock verifying paymaster
- An Anvil node
- ERC-4337 related contracts, including the EntryPoint and account factories for all major ERC-4337 account implementations.

The test environment is orchestrated using **docker compose**. Where the docker containers are pulled from [this repo](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/mock-aa-environment).

The mock environment is designed to mimic mainnet as closely as possible by building with the latest Alto version and by deploying all contracts (entrypoints, paymasters, smart account factories, etc.)

This has advantages over testing against a production testnet as you have more control over the testing environment and can make use of features like anvil cheatcodes.

## Steps

::::steps

### Setup

To get started, create a **docker-compose.yaml** file at the root of your test directory with the following contents.

```yaml [docker-compose.yaml]
services:
  anvil:
    image: ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:nightly-f6208d8db68f9acbe4ff8cd76958309efb61ea0b
    ports: [ "8545:8545" ]
    entrypoint: [ "anvil", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--block-time", "0.1", "--silent"]
    platform: linux/amd64/v8

  mock-paymaster:
    image: ghcr.io/pimlicolabs/mock-verifying-paymaster:main
    ports: [ "3000:3000" ]
    environment:
      - ALTO_RPC=http://alto:4337
      - ANVIL_RPC=http://anvil:8545

  alto:
    image: ghcr.io/pimlicolabs/mock-alto-bundler:main
    ports: [ "4337:4337" ]
    environment:
      - ANVIL_RPC=http://anvil:8545
```

To start the test environment, run

```sh
docker compose up
```

Once docker has started, the following services can be accessed locally through the following endpoints:
- `Anvil` at **localhost:8545**
- `Alto Bundler` at **localhost:4337**
- `Mock Paymaster` at **localhost:3000**

You can now use permissionless like you normally would but instead of referencing the live endpoints, use the local endpoints mentioned above when creating the clients.

```ts [clients.ts]
import { createBundlerClient, ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07 } from 'permissionless'
import { createPimlicoPaymasterClient } from "permissionless/clients/pimlico"
import { http, createPublicClient } from "viem"
import { foundry } from 'viem/chains'

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  transport: http("http://localhost:8545"), // [!code ++]
})

const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
  chain: foundry,
  transport: http("http://localhost:4337"), // [!code ++]
  entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
})

const paymasterClient = createPimlicoPaymasterClient({
  chain: foundry,
  transport: http("http://localhost:3000"), // [!code ++]
  entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
})
```

:::info
Note: All smart account types supported by permissionless.js will work out of the box as all related factories and modules are deployed on the local anvil instance.

### Vitest Integration

You can add scripts in your **package.json** to automatically set up and tear down your mock environment when running tests.

```json [package.json]
{
    "name": "aa-tests",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "bun run docker:up && vitest run && bun run docker:down",
        "docker:up": "docker-compose up -d", // [!code ++]
        "docker:down": "docker-compose down" // [!code ++]
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "viem": "^2.9.17",
        "permissionless": "^0.1.24"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "vitest": "^1.5.2"
    }
}
```

When writing test cases, ensure that the bundler and paymaster are fully setup before sending any request to them. To do this, make a simple health check in the `beforeAll` declaration.

:::code-group
```ts [basic.test.ts]
import { beforeAll, describe, expect, test } from "vitest"
import { ensureBundlerIsReady, ensurePaymasterIsReady } from "./healthCheck"
import { foundry } from 'viem/chains'
import { http } from "viem"
import {
    createBundlerClient,
    ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06,
    ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07
} from 'permissionless'

describe("Test basic bundler functions", () => {
    beforeAll(async () => {             // [!code ++]
        await ensureBundlerIsReady()    // [!code ++]
        await ensurePaymasterIsReady()  // [!code ++]
    })                                  // [!code ++]

    test("Can get chainId", async () => {
      const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
        chain: foundry,
        transport: http("http://localhost:4337"),
        entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
      })

      const chainId = await bundlerClient.chainId()

      expect(chainId).toEqual(foundry.id)
    })

    test("Can get supported entryPoints", async () => {
      const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
        chain: foundry,
        transport: http("http://localhost:4337"),
        entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
      })

      const supportedEntryPoints = await bundlerClient.supportedEntryPoints()

      expect(supportedEntryPoints).toEqual([ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06, ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07])
    })
})
```

```ts [healthCheck.ts]
import { createBundlerClient, ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07 } from 'permissionless'
import { http } from "viem"
import { foundry } from 'viem/chains'

export const ensureBundlerIsReady = async () => {
  const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
    chain: foundry,
    transport: http("http://localhost:4337"),
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
  })

  while (true) {
    try {
      await bundlerClient.chainId()
      return
    } catch {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
    }
  }
}

export const ensurePaymasterIsReady = async () => {
  while (true) {
    try {
      // mock paymaster will open up this endpoint when ready
      const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/ping`)
      const data = await res.json()
      if (data.message !== "pong") {
        throw new Error("paymaster not ready yet")
      }

      return
    } catch {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
    }
  }
}
```

For a more detailed example, take a look at the [permissionless.js E2E integration tests](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/permissionless.js/tree/main/packages/permissionless-test) which uses the same mock environment as this guide.

### Extension: Testing against forked state

If you want your tests to run against a live blockchain, you can slightly edit the **docker-compose.yaml** file to fork from the latest block by adding the anvil flag **--fork-url** and the environment variable **SKIP_DEPLOYMENTS** to skip the local contract deployments.

```yaml [docker-compose.yaml]
services:
  anvil:
    image: ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:nightly-f6208d8db68f9acbe4ff8cd76958309efb61ea0b
    ports: [ "8545:8545" ]
    entrypoint: [ "anvil", "--fork-url", "https://rpc.sepolia.org", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--block-time", "0.1", "--silent"] // [!code ++]
    platform: linux/amd64/v8

  mock-paymaster:
    image: ghcr.io/pimlicolabs/mock-verifying-paymaster:main
    ports: [ "3000:3000" ]
    environment:
      - ALTO_RPC=http://alto:4337
      - ANVIL_RPC=http://anvil:8545

  alto:
    image: ghcr.io/pimlicolabs/mock-alto-bundler:main
    ports: [ "4337:4337" ]
    environment:
      - ANVIL_RPC=http://anvil:8545
      - SKIP_DEPLOYMENTS=true // [!code ++]
```
